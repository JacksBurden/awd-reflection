  communication: { name: 'Communication', description: 'Students write both to learn and to communicate what they learn.',

  negotiation: { name: 'Negotiation', description: 'Students negotiate their own writing goals and audience expectations regarding conventions of genre, medium, and situation.',

  revision: { name: 'Revision', description: 'Students revise their writing using responses from others, including peers, consultants, and teachers.',

  review: { name: 'Peer Review', description: 'Students provide revision-based response to their peers',

  reflection: { name: 'Reflection', description: 'Students reflect on their writing processes and self-assess as writers.',
    tips: "Reflect on your process at every step. Before starting a new paper, recall what went right and wrong last time and plan ahead. After finishing a paper, be sure to note the difficulties of your writing process and possible improvements for next time."}
